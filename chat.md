A journey that began at just 14 years of age…

Born in Samrau, near Jodhpur, Rajasthan in 1991, Mr. Dinesh Kumar discovered his passion for craftsmanship early. At the young age of 14 (in 2005), he began learning carpentry in Mumbai under the guidance of his mentor, Mistry Mohan Lal. Starting as a labourer, he absorbed the skills, discipline, and eye for detail that later became the foundation of his entrepreneurial journey.

After 3 years in Mumbai and 3 years in Chennai, Dinesh continued to sharpen his expertise, working across diverse projects and learning every aspect of the fit-out industry. In 2014, he moved to Hyderabad, determined to turn his experience into his own enterprise.

In 2010, his younger brother Subhash Kumar joined hands to support the expansion. Together, they nurtured DK Interiors into a growing business, guided by a simple philosophy: quality work, timely delivery, and long-term client trust.

Today, with 20+ years of collective experience, DK Interiors stands as a trusted fit-out partner for premium retail, jewellery, lifestyle, and corporate spaces. The firm proudly collaborates with renowned brands like PMJ Jewels, Manyavar, Raymond, Anu Jewellers, and more — delivering interiors that combine craftsmanship with modern innovation.

✅ Website Highlight Line (short version):
“From a 14-year-old apprentice in Mumbai to a trusted fit-out entrepreneur, Dinesh Kumar has built DK Interiors into a name known for quality, speed, and precision.”
